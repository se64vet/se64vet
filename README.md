<em>As a full-stack-driven developer, I create responsive web applications using diverse frameworks and tools, delivering user-friendly UIs and robust back-end services that meet their needs and expectations.
<br><br>
I am also pursuing my Bachelor degree at the University of Tennessee, where I am learning the fundamentals of computer science, programming, and data structures. I have completed projects and assignments using languages such as JavaScript, C++, HTML, CSS, SQL, and no-SQL. I am very excited to work in an innovative environment and eager to join a driven team of developers to contribute technical expertise.
